### Setup Instructions

1. Ensure that the WordPress default Twenty Fourteen theme is installed.
2. Install Twenty Fourteen for EDD and activate it. 
3. If EDD is not installed and activated, do so. 
4. Once EDD is installed, or if it was already installed, you should have a series of WordPress pages created already: Checkout, Success (Purchase Confirmation), and Failed Transactions. Though these pages will display just fine as-is, you should edit them and change their Page Templates setting to the corresponding page templates built into this theme. If these default pages do not exist, see the [EDD Plugin Pages](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/docs/the-plugin-pages/) to set up the default pages. For all other templates listed in the Page Templates, simple create a new page, give it an appropriate title, and select the corresponding template.
5. Visit the WordPress customizer in your dashboard to customize your new EDD Options.
